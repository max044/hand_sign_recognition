# hand_sign_recognition
Hand sign recognition using a specific nearest neighbors algorithm for high dimensionalities.

# Why this project ?
I did this project during my first semester at **SFSU**. It is my term project of Big Data class.<br>
I worked on it during 2 month and the goal was to read, understand and implement a research paper.<br>
The paper I worked on has been write by Sameer A. Nene and Shree K. Nayar is available [here](https://cave.cs.columbia.edu/old/publications/pdfs/Nene_PAMI97.pdf "A Simple Algorithm for Nearest Neighbor Search in High Dimensions").

# How to run
1. Download the code
2. Download the [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist "mnist dataset")
3. Combine train and test csv on a single file (34628 lines)
4. Create env and install the requirements
5. open "process_fnn.ipynb" and run cells

## Info
knn_env python version: 3.10 (virtual environment not shared in sources).<br>
Source code is in **models_code** folder.<br>
